## Example Passage

> The email arrived at 11:47 PM on March 15, 2019. Subject line: "You need to see this."
>
> The sender, a mid-level engineer at TechCorp who agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity, had attached forty-seven pages of internal documents. What they revealed would eventually lead to the largest privacy settlement in FTC history.
>
> The documents showed that TechCorp had been collecting location data from users who had explicitly disabled location tracking. Not occasionally. Not accidentally. Systematically, for eighteen months, across 23 million devices.
>
> "We knew it was happening," the engineer told me during our second meeting, at a coffee shop three towns away from their office. "We called it 'passive collection' in meetings. Made it sound benign." They pulled out a laptop and showed me Slack messages between product managers. One message, dated August 2018, was particularly revealing: "Legal says we're technically compliant as long as we don't use the word 'track' in the settings menu."
>
> Three weeks later, I had corroborated the engineer's claims with two additional sources and obtained emails between TechCorp executives discussing the data collection program.
