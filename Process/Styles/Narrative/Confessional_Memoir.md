## Example Passage

> I was eleven the first time I stole my mother's Xanax. I can tell you the exact date—March 15, 1997—because it was the day after my birthday party that nobody came to. I'd spent the evening counting the pizza slices we'd ordered for twenty kids. There were nineteen slices left.
>
> My mother found me on the bathroom floor three hours later. I don't remember much about the hospital except that the lights were very bright and the psychiatrist had a coffee stain on his tie. He asked me if I wanted to hurt myself. I wanted to tell him that I wanted to disappear. That there's a difference. But I was eleven and I didn't have those words yet.
>
> This is the part where I'm supposed to tell you it got better. That I learned to ask for help or found the right therapist or discovered some redemptive truth that made sense of everything. But that's not what happened. What happened is that I got very good at hiding.
>
> I got good at smiling at school and falling apart at home. At eating lunch in the bathroom stall so I could cry without anyone seeing. At convincing adults I was fine because adults desperately want children to be fine. It's easier for everyone that way.
