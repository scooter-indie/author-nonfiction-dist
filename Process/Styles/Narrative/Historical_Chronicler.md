## Example Passage

> On the morning of March 25, 1911, the workers at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory climbed the narrow staircases to the eighth, ninth, and tenth floors as they had every Saturday. Most were young women, many still teenagers, immigrants from Italy and Eastern Europe who sent their wages home to families they hadn't seen in years. By 4:45 PM, 146 of them would be dead.
>
> The fire started in a rag bin on the eighth floor at 4:40 PM—five minutes before closing time. Within three minutes, flames had engulfed the floor. Workers rushed to the exits and found them locked. Managers had made this a practice to prevent theft and unauthorized breaks. The single fire escape, rusted and poorly maintained, collapsed under the weight of fleeing workers. Some jumped from windows. Others burned.
>
> What the factory owners couldn't have known—or perhaps chose not to know—was that their deaths would ignite a movement that would transform American labor law.
