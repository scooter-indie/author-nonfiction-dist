## Example Passage

> I was standing in the emergency room at 2 AM when I finally understood what my father had been trying to tell me for twenty years. The attending physician—a woman who looked about twelve years old but had clearly not slept in days—was explaining something about enzyme levels and liver function. My father lay on the gurney, unconscious, his skin the color of old newspapers.
>
> "We need to know his medical history," she said. "Any chronic conditions? Medications?"
>
> I realized I didn't know. Despite two decades of Sunday dinners and holiday visits, I couldn't answer the simplest questions about the man who raised me. The physician waited, pen poised over her tablet. In that silence, I heard my father's voice from countless conversations I'd tuned out: "You think you're listening, but you're just waiting to talk."
>
> This moment would change how I understood attention—not as a skill, but as an act of love.
