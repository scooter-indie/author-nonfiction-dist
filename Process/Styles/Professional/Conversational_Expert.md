## Example Passage

> You know that feeling when you walk into a meeting and immediately sense the tension? Nobody's saying anything directly, but you can tell something's off. I watched this happen last week with a client's leadership team. The CEO started a routine status update, but within minutes it had spiraled into a complaint session about cross-functional alignment. Fifteen minutes in, they'd accomplished nothing and demoralized everyone.
>
> This is what I call "meeting drift," and it happens when there's no clear anchor. Here's the thing: the research on meeting effectiveness is brutal. Studies show that 71% of executives consider meetings unproductive (Rogelberg, 2019). But here's what most people miss—it's not the meeting that's the problem. It's the lack of intentional structure. Let me show you a simple framework that changes everything.
