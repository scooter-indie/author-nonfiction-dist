## Example Passage

> Most organizations struggle with a paradox: they want innovation, but their systems reward conformity. I've seen this play out dozens of times. A company launches an "innovation initiative," complete with dedicated teams and substantial budgets. Eighteen months later, the same risk-averse culture persists.
>
> The issue isn't commitment or resources. It's misaligned incentives. Consider three common patterns:
>
> 1. **Promotion criteria emphasize execution** over experimentation. Managers who deliver predictable results advance faster than those who try new approaches.
>
> 2. **Budget processes penalize failed experiments.** Teams learn to propose only "safe" projects that won't damage their funding prospects.
>
> 3. **Performance reviews focus on individual achievement** rather than collaborative discovery, discouraging the knowledge-sharing that drives innovation.
>
> The solution requires restructuring these systems, not just changing the rhetoric. Here's how leading organizations make this shift.
