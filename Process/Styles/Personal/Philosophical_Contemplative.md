## Example Passage

> What does it mean to live authentically? We use this word—authentic—constantly. "Be authentic," we tell each other. "Live your authentic life." But pause here. What are we actually saying? That there's a "real you" somewhere beneath the roles you play? Or that authenticity is something you create through choices?
>
> The ancient Greeks had a different question: not "Who am I really?" but "What kind of person am I becoming?" Notice the shift. One assumes a fixed self waiting to be discovered. The other suggests self as perpetual creation. Which feels more true to your experience?
>
> Consider your own life. In the past year, you've likely played many roles: employee, friend, child, parent, partner. Were you being "inauthentic" in any of these? Or were you being differently authentic—bringing different aspects of yourself forward in different contexts?
>
> Perhaps the question isn't about discovering some essential self, but about integrity across contexts. Not "Am I being my real self?" but "Am I being consistent with my values, even as I adapt to different situations?" This reframing changes everything. It makes authenticity less about revelation and more about integration.
