## Example Passage

> Let's build your first effective morning routine. Don't worry—we're not aiming for a 5 AM wake-up and two hours of optimization. We're creating something sustainable that actually improves your day.
>
> **Step 1: Choose Your Foundation Activity**
>
> Pick one activity that genuinely matters to you. Not what productivity gurus say you should do. What do you wish you had time for? Reading? Exercise? Meditation? Creative work? Choose just one for now.
>
> Write it here: _______________
>
> **Step 2: Find Your Minimum Viable Time**
>
> How long could you do this activity every single day without fail? Not on your best day—on your worst day. If you picked reading and you're thinking "an hour," try fifteen minutes instead. We're building consistency, not intensity.
>
> Your minimum time: _____ minutes
>
> **Step 3: Identify Your Trigger**
>
> What happens every single morning that could signal "time for my foundation activity"? Making coffee? Brushing your teeth? Sitting at your desk?
>
> Your trigger: _______________
>
> Now here's the key: Immediately after your trigger, do your foundation activity. Same trigger, same activity, every day. For the next seven days, that's your only goal.
