## Example Passage

> I'll never forget the woman who approached me after a workshop in Seattle. She waited until everyone else had left, then said, "I've been planning to start my business for seven years. Seven years. I have the business plan. I've taken the courses. I know exactly what I'd do. But I can't seem to actually... start."
>
> I asked her one question: "What are you making it mean about yourself if you try and it doesn't work?"
>
> She started crying. Not sad tears—recognition tears. "That I was foolish to think I could do this. That everyone was right to doubt me."
>
> Here's what I want you to understand: The voice telling you to wait until you're ready isn't protecting you. It's protecting itself. Because that voice exists in the gap between who you are and who you're becoming. And it knows that the moment you take action, its power over you begins to fade.
>
> You don't need more preparation. You don't need more certainty. You need to decide that the discomfort of staying stuck is finally greater than the discomfort of moving forward.
>
> What would you do tomorrow if you knew you couldn't fail? Not five years from now. Tomorrow. Write it down. Then ask yourself: What's the smallest version of that I could do this week?
