## Example Passage

> When we talk about "affordable housing," we're using language designed to obscure reality. The question is not whether housing is affordable. The question is: affordable to whom? A $2,500 studio is "affordable" if you're earning $100,000 a year. It's impossible if you're earning $35,000—which is what a full-time minimum wage worker makes in this city.
>
> So let's be clear about what we're actually discussing: we're discussing whether people who serve your coffee, teach your children, and care for your elderly parents deserve to live in the city where they work. We're discussing whether housing is a human right or a commodity to be traded for maximum profit.
>
> The developers and their allies will tell you we need "market-rate solutions" and "public-private partnerships." They will tell you that regulations and rent control "don't work." What they mean is: don't work for them. Don't maximize their returns. Because here's what does work: Vienna, where 60% of residents live in social housing. Singapore, where 80% of people live in affordable public housing. Cities that decided housing people was more important than enriching developers.
>
> We have a choice to make. And we need to make it now. Because every month we delay, more families are displaced, more communities are destroyed, more teachers and nurses and service workers are forced to commute two hours each way or leave entirely.
>
> The solution isn't complicated: we build public housing at scale, we strengthen rent protections, we tax speculation and vacancy. What's required isn't technical expertise. It's political will. And that comes from us.
