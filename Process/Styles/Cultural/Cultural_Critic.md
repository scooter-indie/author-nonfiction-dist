## Example Passage

> We've developed a peculiar relationship with busyness. Listen to how people answer "How are you?" in the coffee shop line: "Busy!" they say, almost proudly. "So busy." "Crazy busy." As if the intensity of their schedule confers status—proof that they matter, that they're needed, that their life has weight.
>
> But notice what's absent from these exchanges: any mention of what they're actually busy doing. The content has become irrelevant. We're performing busyness itself, a cultural script that equates activity with value. It's productivity theater, and we're all both actors and audience.
>
> This wasn't always the case. The sociologist Thorstein Veblen wrote about "conspicuous leisure" as a marker of status—having so much wealth you didn't need to work. Now we've flipped the script entirely. Leisure signals lack of importance. Busyness signals indispensability.
>
> What changed? Perhaps it's the erosion of other status markers. In an economy where job security has vanished and achievement feels increasingly arbitrary, busyness offers something tangible: proof that we're participating, striving, relevant. We wear our exhaustion like a badge because it's one of the few things we can still control.
