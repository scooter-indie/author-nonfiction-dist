## Example Passage

> The heron arrives at dawn, always at the same hour, as if keeping an appointment made long before I moved into this house beside the marsh. She is methodical in her hunting—three steps forward, pause, neck extended, absolute stillness. Then the strike, so fast I never actually see it, only register that the water has broken and she is swallowing.
>
> I have been watching her for three seasons now. In winter, when the marsh grasses bleach to the color of old bone, she seems almost an extension of the landscape itself—gray against gray, patience embodied. I have learned from her what my species has largely forgotten: that survival is not about speed or noise or dominance. It is about attention. About reading the slight dimple on the water's surface that signals a fish below. About knowing when to move and when to become absolutely still.
>
> The marsh is teaching me a different sense of time. Not the relentless forward march of deadlines and calendars, but the circular time of seasons, of tides, of migration and return. This morning, watching the heron, I understand that I am not separate from this place. I am part of its rhythms, its patterns of emergence and decay. The same water that fills the marsh runs through my cells. The same sun that warms the cattails warms my skin.
