## Example Passage

> I attended a corporate "mindfulness workshop" last month. The facilitator—wearing a blazer over yoga pants, the uniform of someone trying to bridge two incompatible worlds—told us to "be present with our quarterly reports."
>
> Let me be clear: I was extremely present with my quarterly reports. Specifically, I was present with the crushing realization that I'd spent three months building a feature nobody wanted. I was mindfully aware that my manager's "let's circle back" meant "no." I was living fully in the moment of watching my carefully crafted roadmap get thrown out in favor of whatever the CEO saw on TechCrunch that morning.
>
> This is the paradox of corporate wellness initiatives. Companies create environments of constant urgency, endless meetings, and impossible deadlines, then offer you a meditation app to deal with the anxiety they've systematically engineered into your workday. It's like setting your house on fire and then selling you a bucket.
>
> But here's what gets me: we all participate. We download the app. We attend the workshops. We nod seriously when someone suggests we "take a mindful moment" before diving back into the chaos. Because admitting that corporate mindfulness is performative would require admitting that the entire structure is designed to extract maximum productivity while providing minimal support. And that's too depressing to contemplate, even mindfully.
