## Example Passage

> I went to the monastery seeking answers. What I found instead was silence. Not the absence of sound—though the mornings were quiet enough—but the presence of something deeper. A silence that held space for questions I didn't yet know how to ask.
>
> Brother Thomas, who had lived there for forty years, told me that prayer is not about getting God to listen. "God is already listening," he said, pouring tea with the same attention he brought to everything. "Prayer is about becoming quiet enough to hear."
>
> This is what the contemplative traditions understand: that the spiritual life is not about accumulating religious knowledge or perfecting our behavior. It is about learning to pay attention. To notice the holy in the ordinary. To recognize that every moment, if we are awake to it, is an invitation to encounter mystery.
>
> What would change if we approached each day as sacred? Not in some grand, mystical sense, but in the simple recognition that this moment—this breath, this conversation, this challenge before us—is where the divine and the human meet?
>
> The Buddhists speak of beginner's mind. The Christians of dying to self. The Sufis of fana, annihilation of ego. Different languages for the same truth: that spiritual awakening requires letting go of our certainty about who we are and what we know. It requires becoming, as Brother Thomas said, quiet enough to hear.
