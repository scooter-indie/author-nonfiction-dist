## Example Passage

> The buzzer shot is the closest thing sports has to a religious experience. Three seconds left. Down by two. The ball in your hands, 30 feet from the basket, and 15,000 people holding their breath.
>
> People who don't play basketball don't understand the silence that comes in that moment. Not actual silence—the crowd is screaming—but the internal quiet when everything narrows to the rim. Muscle memory takes over. The thousands of shots you've taken in practice, alone in the gym when no one was watching. Your body knows what to do.
>
> I'd visualized this shot a hundred times. What I hadn't visualized was the weight of it. The knowledge that this single moment would define the season. Maybe my career. That everything—every early morning practice, every injury I'd played through, every time I chose the gym over everything else—came down to whether this ball went through that hoop.
>
> The thing about sports is that it's one of the few places in life where you get absolute clarity. The ball either goes in or it doesn't. You win or you lose. There's no ambiguity, no interpretation. Just brutal, beautiful truth.
>
> (The ball went in. But that's not actually the point. The point is what happens in those three seconds when you don't know yet—when all you have is the arc of the ball and the faith that you've prepared enough.)
