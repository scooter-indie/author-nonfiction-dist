## Example Passage

> The relationship between organizational culture and performance outcomes has been extensively documented in management literature (Schein, 2010; Cameron & Quinn, 2011). However, the mechanisms through which cultural attributes translate into measurable results remain subject to considerable debate. This study proposes a mediating role for leadership behaviors, specifically those aligned with transformational leadership theory (Bass & Riggio, 2006). By examining three case organizations across distinct sectors, the research demonstrates that cultural alignment significantly influences performance metrics when moderated by leadership intervention. The findings contribute to existing theory by specifying conditional factors that enhance or inhibit the culture-performance relationship, thereby addressing gaps identified in recent meta-analyses (Hartnell et al., 2019).
