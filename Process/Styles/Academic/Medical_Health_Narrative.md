## Example Passage

> The biopsy results came back on a Tuesday. I know this because I was teaching anatomy to first-year medical students when my phone buzzed. Breast cancer, stage 2. I stood there explaining the lymphatic system while my own lymph nodes were harboring malignant cells.
>
> The irony wasn't lost on me. I'd spent fifteen years as an oncologist, delivering diagnoses just like this one. I thought I understood what my patients felt when I said those words. I was wrong.
>
> There's a peculiar doubleness to being both doctor and patient. I could read my pathology report fluently, understood every abbreviation and tumor marker. But I also cried in the hospital parking lot, terrified in a way that has nothing to do with medical knowledge. The brain knows statistics. The body knows fear.
>
> What surprised me most was how the illness became a threshold. Not to some redemptive transformation—there's no redemption in cancer. But to a different way of inhabiting time. When you don't know how much you have left, moments become sharper. The taste of coffee. Your daughter's laugh. The exact quality of autumn light.
>
> This is what I couldn't teach my students: that medicine is as much about bearing witness to suffering as it is about treating disease.
